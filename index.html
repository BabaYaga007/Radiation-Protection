			<h2><u>Radiation</u></h2>
			<div>
				<h4>The emission and propagation of energy in the form of rays or waves is called Radiation.
				Radiation is all around us, in the air we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink. Radiation is natural, but the excess radiation due to our activities is unnatural. </h4>

			<h2>Radiation in Our Daily Lives</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Radiation due to Electronics</h3>
				<div>
					<h4>
						For years, people have become increasingly worried about the dangers of high-frequency radiation from cell phones, wireless telephones, routers, the rear side of microwave ovens, and cell sites within 400 meters of homes and places of study and work, as well as from low-frequency sources of radiation such as AC high-voltage wires, power transformers, and house wires and extension wires passing close to the headboards of beds. Technological change always results between benefit and harm, including laptop or mobile phone. Electronic devices offer computing functions, phone calls, internet connections, light up panels, and so many more capabilities. As a by-product of these functions operating, an electric current is generated that flows within and between components creating Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs). These fields are also known as Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) Electromagnetic Radiation (EMF). Some of the most common risks that we might encounter are exposure to electromagnetic radiation or the risk of electric shocks. 
						<div></div>
						The mobile phone is one of the major contributor to radiation 
						Mobile or cell phones are now a days an integral part of modern telecommunications in every individual life. In many countries, over half of the population use mobile phones and the mobile phone market is growing rapidly.
						Mobile phones emit radiofrequency energy, a form of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation, which can be absorbed by tissues close to the phone. The amount of radiofrequency energy a mobile phone user is exposed depend on many factors as the technology of the phone, the distance between the phone and the user, the extent and type of mobile phone use and the user’s distance from cell phone towers.
						<div></div>
						While an increased risk of brain tumours from the use of mobile phones is not established, the increasing use of mobile phones and the lack of data for mobile phone use over time periods longer than 15 years warrant further research of mobile phone use and brain cancer risk. In particular, with the recent popularity of mobile phone use among younger people, potentially longer lifetime of exposure, WHO has promoted further research on this group and is currently assessing the health impact of RF fields on all studied endpoints. A cohort study in Denmark linked billing information from more than 358,000 cell phone subscribers with brain tumour incidence data from the Danish Cancer Registry. The analyses found no association between cell phone use and the incidence of glioma, meningioma, or acoustic neuroma, even among people who had been cell phone subscribers for 13 or more years.

				<h3>Probable Solutions</h3>
				<div>
						<h4>Possible fixes:
					    <ol>
					    	<div>1) Avoid carrying your cell phone directly on your body.</div>
					    	<div>2) Never sleep with a cell phone switched on at night beside your bed.</div>
					    	<div>3) Avoid using your cell phone if you are feeling in any way run down.</div>
					    	<div>4) Prefer text messaging to making calls with your cell phone.</div>
					    	<div>5) Switch Sides of Head When Talking.</div>

				<h3>Food and Water</h3>
				<div>
					<h4>
					When radioactive materials are deposited on plants, soil or water, they enter the food chain. In the first instance, plants and animals will be surface-contaminated and tissue contamination may occur later. This tissue contamination will be reduced over time. After radiation entered the food chain, people can directly or indirectly ingest radioactive materials through direct intake of radioactively contaminated foodstuffs or through eating certain animal products (eg. fish and shellfish) if these animals have eaten radioactively contaminated substances and such substances will accumulate inside their body.
					<div></div>
					Consuming food contaminated with radioactive material will increase the amount of radioactivity a person is exposed to and could increase the health risks associated with exposure to radiation. The exact impacts depend on which radionuclides have been ingested and their amount. For instance, radioactive iodine can accumulate in the human body, particularly in the thyroid gland. It has a half-life of eight days and decays naturally within weeks. As for radioactive cesium, it has a half-life as long as several decades. It is necessary to monitor closely the situation of food contamination by radioactive cesium on a long term basis since ingestion of food contaminated by it can pose long-term health impacts.
					</h4>

				</div>
				<h3>Probable Solutions</h3>
				<div>
					<h4>
						1. Take iodine supplements. Iodine protects the thyroid, the place in the body where radiation most likes to “lodge.” With plenty of iodine in you system, hormone receptors remain full and radioactive iodine will have no room to land. Make sure to get your levels checked first and that your supplement contains both potassium iodide and iodine.
						2. Up your levels of Vitamin C. Vitamin C is a free-radical scavenger and a strong antioxidant. Likewise, you can’t really “overdo it” when it comes to how much you take (if you have taken too much, your body will let you know it’s had enough by the presence of loose stool). Taking at much as 5,000 mgs or more of vitamin C – every day – will not hurt you.  In contrast, it will boost your immune system and help detox radiation contaminants.
						3. How to reduce the level of radioactive materials in food through food preparation?
						Residual radioactive contamination on surface of food may be reduced by suitable food preparation such as washing, brushing, scrubbing, peeling off the outer skin or removing outer leaves. Yet, these produce no effect upon food being contaminated internally. It is also possible to store contaminated food for prolonged times to allow radioactive decay of short-lived radioactive materials contained in food. Cooking in general cannot reduce the level of radioactive contamination in food.
					</h4>
				</div>
				<h3>Ozone Depletion </h3>
				<div>
					<h4>The ozone layer acts like a giant sunshade, protecting plants and animals from much of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.
					Global stratospheric ozone levels have declined, which means that the ozone layer is changing. Stratospheric ozone has large natural temporal and spatial variations, up to 30 percent variation may be regarded as normal. However, we now have evidence of a significant thinning of the ozone layer during spring and summer. This is observed in both the northern and the southern hemispheres at middle and high latitudes. During the last 10-15 years, the ozone layer above the northern hemisphere has been reduced by 5-6 percent in spring per decade. The latest tests (January-March 1995) have shown very large reductions, with a maximum of more than 30 percent reduction compared to normal.
					A depletion of the ozone layer will increase the UV-radiation at ground level. Increasing doses of UV-B may cause skin cancer, eye cataracts, damage to the immune system in animals as well as human beings, and have an adverse impact on plant growth
					Ozone depletion has major impacts on the environment too like increasing radiation in the water, global warming and materials like PVC sidings, window and door frames, pipes, gutters degrade faster.
					</h4>
				</div>
					<h3>Probable Fixes</h3>
					<div>
					<h4>
					The fix for the ozone problem is a simple one plant more trees, reduce your carbon footprint example by taking the public transport. These fixes might sound small but if you can convince other people to do the same it will make a huge different.
